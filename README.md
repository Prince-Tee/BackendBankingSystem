This Python script is ignited from Opecstat academy. I just did a little 
changes to better understand it 
- the __init__ funtion is basically 
setting a varaible 'balance' which will be at '10,000'at the end of the 
script 
-in the first 5 lines of the 'dep' function an input is taken 
from the user to know if they want to deposit if their reply is 'Y' then 
it takes further input and adds it to the existing balance. -If they 
choose not to deposit and they type in 'N, they are prompted to withdraw.
if the withdrawal is greater than the balance they are prompted with a meessage that they can't.
if it it less than the balance it executes the operation and a successful withdrawal is printed with the new balance.


THANK YOU !!!!
